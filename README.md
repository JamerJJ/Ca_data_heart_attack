# Ca_data_heart_attack


#I completed a course project in Foundations of Data Science, where I focused on analyzing cardiovascular risk factors. The goal of the project was to check and analyze the provided dataset to uncover relationships #that influence the likelihood of a heart attack. I utilized the pandas library in Python for data manipulation and analysis to derive insights into the factors contributing to the risk of a heart attack.
